# Udacity-MyStore

This project is part of the Udacity Full Stack JavaScript Developer Nanodegree. The intent was to create a Storefront Web Front-End using Angular. It allows a user to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. It uses local JSON data and does not connect to a backend.

## Prereqs

- Node
  - I built and tested with v17.7.1
- Angular CLI
  - I built and tested with v15.0.4

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `ng serve` to run the web server locally.
4. Once successfully running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser of choice.
